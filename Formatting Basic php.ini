Formatting Basic php
This section outline various, general formatting rules related to whitespace and text.

Line length MUST NOT exceed 80 characters, unless it is text
i.e. |---- 80+ chars ----| → refactor expression and/or break list values
Line indentation MUST be accomplished using tabs
i.e. function func() { ↵ ⇥ ... ↵ }
Blank lines SHOULD be added between logical blocks of code
i.e. ... ↵ ↵ ...
Text alignment MUST be accomplished using spaces
i.e. $var · · · = ...;
Trailing whitespace MUST NOT be present after statements or serial comma break or on blank lines
i.e. no ... · · ↵ · ↵ ...
Keywords MUST be all lowercase
e.g. false, true, null, etc.
Variables MUST be all lowercase and words MUST be separated by an underscore
e.g. $welcome_message
Global variables MUST be declared one variable per line and MUST be indented after the first
e.g. global $var1, ↵ ⇥ $var2;
Constants MUST be all uppercase and words MUST be separated by an underscore
e.g. WELCOME_MESSAGE
Statements MUST be placed on their own line and MUST end with a semicolon
e.g. welcome_message();
Operators MUST be surrounded by a space
e.g. $total = 15 + 7;, $var .= '';
Unary operators MUST be attached to their variable or integer
e.g. $index++, --$index
Concatenation period MUST be surrounded by a space
e.g. echo 'Read:' . $welcome_message;
Single quotes MUST be used
e.g. echo 'Hello, World!';
Double quotes SHOULD NOT be used
e.g. echo "Read: $welcome_message"; → echo 'Read: ' . $welcome_message;
